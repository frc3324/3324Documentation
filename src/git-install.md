# Installing Git (Incomplete as of 2020-07-07)
The git project provides downloads for the git CLI (and some extras for Windows users). There is a learning curve, but this is probably the best way to familiarize yourself with Git. That being said, if you are on MacOS or Linux, I highly recommend going through a package manager.
## Windows
Download the installer from [the git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Install via homebrew, the macos package manager, or XCode. 
To install homebrew check out [the homebrew website]().

## Making a Github account
