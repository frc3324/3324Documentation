# Installing Git
The Git project provides downloads for the Git CLI (and some extras for Windows users). There is a learning curve, but this is probably the best way to familiarize yourself with Git. That being said, if you are on MacOS or Linux, I highly recommend going through a package manager.
## Windows
Download the installer from [the Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win).

## Linux
Install via your package manager, for a list check out [the Git website](https://git-scm.com/download/linux).

## Macos
Install via homebrew, the macos package manager, or XCode. 
To install homebrew check out [the homebrew website](https://brew.sh/).
For more information, look at the [Git macos download site](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)

## Making a Github account
Go to [github.com](https://github.com), you should see this screen:

And that's it for now!
At this point you have all the tooling required to work with others on the team and many open source projects.
