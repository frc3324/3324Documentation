# Introduction
## What Is This?
This is the 3324 Programming Handbook.
In theory it should cover everything you need to know to get a robot moving with best practices in <20 pages.
There will also be extra content covering more advanced topics in the future, but this is primarily a reference for newer students.
You do not need to read the book cover-to-cover, each section is independent of the others.

## Who This Book Is For
This book is for any student that is interested in learning the fundamental of FRC programming.
It will focus mostly on 3324 (and so will use Kotlin for most examples), but it assume no programming experience and very basic computer literacy.
